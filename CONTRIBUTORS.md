#### Contribution licensing ...

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Alert project shall be under the terms and
conditions of the MIT License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with the
Alert project (or its licensor Daniel Lowrey) regarding such contributions.

#### Before you PR ...

Alert strives to retain minimum compatibility with PHP 5.4. All source code
contributions must execute successfully in this environment.

If you're submitting non-trivial changes to the source code of the project
please add your name to this file as a CONTRIBUTOR. Changes to support
files or minor changes (e.g. whitespace fixes) -- though appreciated --
do not merit addition as a contributor. Thank you in advance!
