/**
 * Running the reactor gives control of program control to the Amp event loop. Once started,
 * the reactor will only stop under one of the following two conditions:
 *
 *   (1) No scheduled events remain outstanding and no IO streams are registered for observation
 *   (2) The event reactor is explicitly stopped using Amp\stop() or calling
 *       Reactor::stop() on the running Reactor instance.
 *
 * The event reactor is our task scheduler. It controls program flow as long as it runs.
 *
 * This example uses Amp's global function API to interact with the event loop. As it really
 * never makes sense to have multiple event loop instances in a single-threaded application the
 * function API is useful for interacting with a statically restricted global loop.
