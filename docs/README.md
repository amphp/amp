# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for `amphp/amp`. Documentation and code are bundled within a single repository for easier maintenance. Additionally, this preserves the documentation for older versions.

## Reading

You can read this documentation either directly on GitHub or on our website. While the website will always contain the latest version, viewing on GitHub also works with older versions.

## Writing

Our documentation is built using Jekyll.

```
sudo gem install bundler jekyll
```

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
